## Introduction

### What is a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)?

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that enables direct communication between the brain and an external device, typically a computer or a robotic system. BCIs are designed to decode neural activity patterns associated with specific mental tasks or intentions and translate them into commands for controlling external devices. These systems are particularly beneficial for individuals with motor disabilities, allowing them to interact with their environment through thought alone.

BCIs commonly use electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are non-invasive brain signals captured from the scalp. EEG signals contain valuable information about brain activity, including responses to motor imagery tasks where a person imagines performing a physical movement, such as moving a limb, without actual movement. These imagined movements generate characteristic patterns in the EEG signal that can be detected and classified by a BCI system.

### How This Code Works

This MATLAB script is designed to process and classify EEG signals recorded during motor imagery tasks. The goal is to distinguish between different imagined movements using a feature known as **energy distribution**, which is derived from the time-frequency representations (TFRs) of the EEG signal. The code is structured to perform several key functions:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load EEG data from a GDF file format using the Biosig toolbox.
   - Preprocess the data by normalizing and filtering to focus on specific frequency bands relevant to motor imagery, typically the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms.

2. **Signal Segmentation:**
   - Segment the continuous EEG data into epochs based on event markers. Each epoch corresponds to a trial of motor imagery, such as imagining left-hand or right-hand movements.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Apply a Butterworth bandpass filter to isolate the frequency bands of interest.
   - Use the Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) technique to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG data for each class.
   - Compute the energy distribution features from the TFR of each epoch using the Wigner-Ville distribution, which provides a detailed view of how signal energy varies over time and frequency.

4. **Classification:**
   - Implement k-fold cross-validation to train and evaluate the performance of a neural network classifier on the extracted features.
   - Use feature selection techniques to identify and retain the most discriminative features for classification.

5. **Results Visualization:**
   - Calculate and display the classification accuracy for each fold, providing an assessment of the model's performance.
   - Visualize the event-related potentials (ERP) and time-frequency representations (TFRs) to show the differences in brain activity patterns associated with different motor imagery tasks.

### Significance

The code provides a framework for developing a BCI system that can accurately classify motor imagery tasks based on EEG signals. By extracting energy distribution features and employing advanced classification techniques, this system demonstrates the potential to enhance the control capabilities of BCIs, making them more responsive and reliable for end-users. This work is a step toward practical applications in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies, where BCIs can empower individuals with physical limitations to regain control and independence.

## Installation

To set up the repository and run the code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Time-Frequency-MotorImagery-BCI.git
   cd Time-Frequency-MotorImagery-BCI
   ```

2. **Install MATLAB:**

   Ensure that MATLAB is installed on your system. You can download MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

3. **Add Required Toolboxes:**

   Make sure the required toolboxes are installed in MATLAB. Add them to your MATLAB path using the following commands:

   ```matlab
   addpath('/path/to/your/tftb-toolbox');   % Time-Frequency Toolbox
   addpath('/path/to/your/eeglab-toolbox'); % EEGLAB Toolbox
   ```

   Replace `'/path/to/your/tftb-toolbox'` and `'/path/to/your/eeglab-toolbox'` with the actual paths to your toolboxes.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. **Prepare Data:**

   Ensure your EEG data is in GDF format and accessible. Modify the `filename` variable in the script to point to your data file. You may need to update file paths for your specific data set.

2. **Run the Script:**

   Open MATLAB and run the main script to start processing and classification:

   for energy distribution features:
   ```matlab
   run('BCI_RPWVEnergy.m');
   ```
   
   for entropy features:
   ```matlab
   run('BCI_RPWVEntropy.m');
   ```
   This command will execute the processing and classification routine.

3. **View Results:**

   Upon completion, the script will display classification accuracy and generate plots for ERP and TFR. These results will help assess the model's performance and visualize EEG signal characteristics.

## File Structure

- `BCI_RPWVEnergy.m` or `BCI_RPWVEntropy.m`: Main MATLAB script for EEG signal processing and classification.
- `emptyEEG.mat`: Placeholder EEG structure for further use.
- `tftb-0.2/mfiles`: Folder containing the Time-Frequency Toolbox scripts.
- `eeglab2024.0`: Folder containing the EEGLAB toolbox.

## Data

- **Input:** EEG data in GDF format. The script processes channels related to motor imagery tasks.
- **Output:** Classification accuracy, entropy or energy distribution features, and plots of ERP and TFR.

## Dependencies

To successfully run the code, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- MATLAB (R2024 or later recommended)
- [Biosig Toolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biosig/)
- [EEGLAB Toolbox](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/)
- [Time-Frequency Toolbox (TFTB)](https://tftb.nongnu.org/)

These toolboxes provide essential functions for signal processing, data loading, and analysis.

## Results

The script calculates and displays the classification accuracy for each fold in the k-fold cross-validation process. It also visualizes the time-frequency representations and both entropy and energy distribution plots for both classes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of EEG signals.
